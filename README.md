## Flask API that exposes cli tools as http endpoints

ðŸš€ Welcome to the comprehensive guide on building a robust Flask API application.

ðŸ“š Topics covered in this code:

1. Setting up Python Virtual Environment: Learn how to create a clean and isolated environment for your Flask project, ensuring smooth package management and avoiding version conflicts.

2. Folder Structure for a Flask API Application: We'll dive into creating a well-organized folder structure that promotes modularity, making your codebase maintainable and extensible.

3. Nested Routing with Flask Blueprint: Master the art of structuring your routes using Flask Blueprints, enhancing code readability and facilitating teamwork.

### Run Application

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omoinjm/njm-tech-api.git
```

2. Create python virutal environment

```bash
python -m venv venv/
```

3. Activate Python Virutal Environment

Windows

```powershell
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux/Mac OS

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the server

```bash
python app.py
```

### Adding Swagger Docs to Existing Flask App

Swagger lets you create an interactive docs route for your flask app. You reference a `swagger.json` file that follows the OpenAPI spec and Swagger handles the front end to make the documentation for your service more engaging and interactive.
